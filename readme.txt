How to compile and execute?
-> normal cpp file execution
1.) g++ -o library lib.cpp
2.) ./library.exe


NOTE:
I have loaded the data of my system in the txt file after the program has been terminated (load when destructor of library object is called).
So, if you want to evaluate whether the operations work on the data please use the options I have provided in the program itself rather than viewing the txt file directly.(or you can exit the program and then view it in the txt file)

After executing the only source file, I have provided different menus for different use-cases to guide you through my program.
